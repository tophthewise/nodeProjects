This app was built to prime myself with node knowledge for the second project duece. Duece is a full stack incorporating both React and Node. This was to familiarize myself with Node for the second project. As you will see the names will go up as the applications become more complex. If you are reading this... Thank you and welcome: this is my journey to full stack development :)
